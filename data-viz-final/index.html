        <h3 class="sec">What makes life in Florida even harder?  </h3>
        <div class="txt">Although jobs are more plentiful than before, not everyone in Florida are making more money than the past.

In Glades, the one which has the highest ALICE households in 2016, the median annual income of a house of 4 (2 adults, 1 infant, 1 preschooler ) is $43,605. While in Nassau, the median earning of a family of 4 per year is $80,275, 84% more than the median wage in Glades. During the past four years, Glades families of 4’s annual income has increased only by 1% compared to 2012 which was $43,149.  In Nassau, the median annual income of a house of 4 (2 adults, 1 infant, 1 preschooler ) is $80,275, 8% more than the annual income in 2012 which was $74,137.

Despite the huge difference between the annual income of households in these two counties, their annual survival budget in 2016 shows little difference.

In Nassau, it costs a family of 4 $56,244 per year just to get by. The budget has increased 23.3% more than what it costed a family in 2012 which was $45,609. Even in this county with the least ALICE households, the wage increasement is far less than the increasement of survival budget. Situation in Glades is even worse. The average of annual survival budget for a family of 4 living in Glades is $52,869, 5.9% more than what it costed a family in 2012 which was $49,756. Even though the difference between the increasement of income and outcome are smaller than that of Nassau, the median income of families in Glades cannot even meet the least survival budget.</div>
